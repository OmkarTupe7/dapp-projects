# A Pet Shop Contract on Arbitrum One

This project is a simple example that allows you to deploy the adoption contract to Arbitrum and run its functions.

The contract lives entirely on L2 / involves no direct L1 interacts; writing, deploying, and interacting with it works just like using an L1 contract.
